# Ogen Configuration

The `ogen.yml` file configures the ogen OpenAPI generator, which is used to generate Go client code from OpenAPI specifications.

## Generator Features

The generator is configured with the following features:

- `paths/client` - Enables paths client generation
- `client/request/validation` - Enables validation of client requests
- `debug/example_tests` - Enables generation of example tests

Other features are disabled with `disable_all: true`.

## Path Filtering

The generator is configured to include all paths with `path_regex: ".*"`. Path filtering is handled manually in the processor module.

## HTTP Methods

The generator is configured to include the following HTTP methods:
- GET
- POST
- PUT
- PATCH
- DELETE

## Parser Options

The parser is configured with the following options:

- `infer_types: true` - Enables type inference for schemas
- `allow_remote: true` - Enables remote references resolving
- `depth_limit: 1000` - Sets the maximum depth of schema generation

## Customizing Ogen Configuration

To customize the ogen configuration:

1. Edit the `ogen.yml` file
2. Run `task generate-clients` to regenerate the clients with the new configuration

## Example Configuration

```yaml
generator:
  features:
    enable:
      - "paths/client"
      - "client/request/validation"
    disable_all: true
  filters:
    path_regex: ".*"
    methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"]

parser:
  infer_types: true
  allow_remote: true
  depth_limit: 1000
```
